/**
 * A company produces two products, Premium Widgets (PW) and Standard Widgets (SW).
 * The company wants to maximize its total revenue, but the revenue functions for each product exhibit diminishing returns due to market saturation.
 * The revenue functions for the products are given as follows: The revenue for Premium Widgets is $100 per unit for the first 50 units,
 * but decreases by $1 per unit for each additional unit produced beyond 50. The revenue for Standard Widgets is $50 per unit for the first 100
 * units, but decreases by $0.5 per unit for each additional unit produced beyond 100.
 * 
 * Constraints: The production capacity for Premium Widgets is between 0 and 150 units. The production capacity for Standard Widgets
 * is between 0 and 200 units. The total production cost should not exceed $20,000, where the cost of producing each Premium Widget
 * is $80 and each Standard Widget is $30.
 * 
 * Objective: Determine the number of Premium Widgets and Standard Widgets to produce in order to maximize the total revenue.
 * With 10 times of iteration.
